# promise-js

Not quite a full implementation of the [Promises/A+](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec), but almost there.

- index.js: Implementation of MyPromise
- index.test.js: Test suite for MyPromise implementation
- promise.test.js: Duplicate of index.test.js, with MyPromises substituted by the default JS Promise
